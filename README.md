Basic instructions for now (will certainly be improved later)

Run the CSV producer to create all the CSVs for both the horse and rider coordinates and bounding boxes.

Then, run the code to make those CSV files into the YOLO format.

Finally, use the yolo trianing code to run yolo training and create your model.

If you would like the weights, full datasets, etc, reach out to me. Thanks
